# Pet-management-APP-
Undergraduate graduation design.
Back-end web is based on JAVA SSM framework, which is supposed to be manipulated by pet shop staff.
And the android app is supposed to be used by pet shop customers.
Clients can use APP to schedule pet service appointments at the shop and also use the APP to track the real-time location of their pets.
Pet shop staff can log in to the web page to accept the appointment and manage the information of pets. Once when the pet service is done, pet shop staff can use the web server to remind pet owners by notication on their phones.
